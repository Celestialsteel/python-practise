# 1. Numlist.py
  Used an empty numlist array requiring input from the main function, in the form of how many numbers and the numbers themselves. Passed to a function that sums up the numbers which the main function calls for the answer. Needed to consult AI on how to store each number and remember/pull them individually without errors for summation(without using the append function).

# 2. Numtype.py
  Uses the modulus operator in the checknumber function. Remainder if odd, no remainder if even
  
# 3. Factorial_loop.py  
  Uses a for loop to  itterarively work through the factorials by incrementing from the base case to the number in question.

# 4. String_reverse.py
  Inspired by something I did in C++. Essentially you have the message to be stored in the string variable(experimented with my own message first before allowing users).this string is sent to the reversal method which has the reversed_string variable(empty).So for every time it gets to the end of the method it takes the character and brings it to the front).

# 5. Factorial.py
   I did this before the loop one...hence the name. Uses recursion to compute the operation, by each time multiplying by the preceding number, until it reaches 1.   

# 6. Num_sum.py 
   Added a How to  approach  the problem in the comments explaining my approach, which essentially came down to somehow isolating the numbers(hence the commmented code) which required string conversion and digit conversion for summation. Similar to string_reverse.
